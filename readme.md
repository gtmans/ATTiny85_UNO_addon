Simple addonboard for Arduino UNO to program an ATTiny trough arduinoISP as described here https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/arjun/programming-attiny85-with-arduino-uno-afb829
with 3d print "case" file. Use a standard experimentboard of 20x70mm. There is one .stl file that you can use on both sides: copy it in the slicer and cutoff anything above 5mm in the slcer to get the 2nd part.
